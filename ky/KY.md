## 第一天上午

```
I see.
我明白了

I quit!
我不干了

Let go!
放手

Me too
我也是

My god
天哪

No way
不行

Come on
来吧（赶快）

Hold on
等一等

I agree
我同意

Not bad
还不错

Not yet
还没

See you
再见

Shut up


So long


Why not


Allow me

Be quiet

Cheer up

Good job


Have fun

How much

I'm full

I'm home

I'm lost

My treat

So do I

This way

After you

Bless you

Follow me


Forget it
休想（）

Good luck

I decline

I promise

Of course

Slow down

Take care


They hurt


Try again

Watch out
```

## 第一天下午

```
What's up

Never mind

Is it yours

To be careful

Be careful

No problem

That's neat

Do me a favor

Bottoms up

That's all

Are you sure

Help yourself

Don't move

Time is up

Do I have to

I'm on a diet

Guess what

What's new

He is my age

Keep in touch

I doubt it

Count me on


Here you are

Time is money

I think so

Don't worry

No one knows

Who's calling

I'm single

Feel better

Take it easy

You did right

Keep it up

I love you 

What a pity

You set me up

Let me see
