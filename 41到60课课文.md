```
一、基数词

adj 十几岁的 青少年的

3、20-90整十数字，由对应的个位数词+ty 构成

eighty ninety
注意：twenty thirty forty fifty eighty 变化不规则

4、非整十的两位数，即表达“几十几”由相对应的整十位数加上连字符—再加个位数构成
21 twenty—one 38 thirty—eight 45 forty—five

5、100-999
整百，写上百位数再加上hundred
two hundred 不是复数，hundred末尾无s
100 one hundred 300 three hundred 700 seven hundred
不是整百即表达“几百几十几”先说几百+and 再说几十几
148 one hundred and forty—eight
679 six hundred and seventy—nine

6、1000以上四位数，拼写规则：用逗号从右往左没三位加一个逗号，第一个逗号读作 thousand 第二个逗号读作million第三个逗号读作billion，hundred后不要忘记and

hundreds of students 数百个学生
thousands of birds数千个鸟

```

序数词

```
三、序数词
基数词变序数词的口诀

second，秒(时间单位)；

1、序数词的变化
1、2、3特殊记，结尾 t.d.d 
first second third
th从四起，八减t,九去e, f来把ve 替
第四fourth 第五 fifth 第八eighth 第九ninth
第十二twelfth

第十八 eighteenth
第十九 nineteenth

整十 ty 变成tie 再加th
twenty-twentieth thirty-thirtieth fifty-fiftieth
若是遇到几十几，只变个位就可以
twenty-three变成twenty-third
ninety-five 变成ninety-fifth

2、序数词的缩写
first  -- 1st 
second -- 2nd 
third  -- 3rd
fourth  -- 4th

one hundredth 100th

序数词前可以加上不定冠词（a/an）用来表示‘再一’（first除外）

try
n v 尝试 试图 努力

We have tried it twice,but we will try it a third time
我们已经试过两次了，但我们将会再试一次

四、数的表达法
如何表达分数、小数、百分数
1、分数表达法：分子用基数词，分母用序数词
五分之一1/5, 读成one fifth. 
分子是1.分母用单数。
分子大于1，分母用复数 2/3 读成 two thirds
分母是2和4时，可用half和quarter 表示
1/2 one half 或者a half
3/4 three fourths或者three quarters
补充：如果分数大于1，要用整数部分+and +分数
5又1/3 读成 five and one thirds

2、百分数表达法：基数词+percent. percent没有复数形式
6% six percent 
30% thirty percent

2、小数表达法，小数点读point ,小数点前后都用基数词
0.45 zero point four five 
6.8 six point eight

两倍用twice / double 
三次以上：基数词+times
倍数 + 比较级 + than句型
This room is twice larger than that room 这个房间比那个大两倍


Monday    Mon
Tuesday   Tue
Wednesday Wed
Thursday  Thu
Friday   Fri

Saturday   Sat
Sunday     Sun 


二，如何用这些单词来表达日期和时间？
我们用逗号和and来连接日期和时间。例如：
Today is Monday, October 14th, 2023.（今天是2023年10月14日星期一。）

Tomorrow is Tuesday, October 15th, 2023.（明天是2023年10月15日星期二。）

The day after tomorrow is Wednesday, October 16th, 2023.（后天是2023年10月16日星期三。）

The day before yesterday was Sunday, October 13th, 2023.（前天是2023年10月13日星期日。）

你看，这些句子都遵循了一个固定的格式：星期+日期+年份。其中，星期用大写字母开头，日期用序数词表示，并加上th或st或nd或rd作为后缀，年份用四位数字表示，并加上逗号和and来分隔。学习这些句子，不仅可以帮助我们记住一周七天的英文单词，也可以帮助我们正确地表达日期和时间。
