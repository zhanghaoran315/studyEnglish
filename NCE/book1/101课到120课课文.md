There is none left.

当代词特别指代复数名词或表达复数概念时，动词往往采用复数形式，反之，动词则用单数。（尤其不可数名词）
There are many apples in the refrigerator.
Some are fresh, some are stale.

Some of the homework is difficult for me.
Is there any beer in the bottle?

Is there any in the bottle?
homework和beer都是不可数名词，搭配单数

Are there any tomatoes in the basket?
Are there any in the basket?

None of the beer is left.
none指代beer，beer不可数名词

None of our passengers have small change.
None of our passengers has small change.

"None of our passengers have small change."
这里将 "none" 视为复数，强调 "not any"（没有一个），因此动词用复数形式 "have"。这种用法在非正式英语中更常见，尤其是当强调 "none" 指代多个个体时。

"None of our passengers has small change."
这里将 "none" 视为单数，强调 "not one"（连一个都没有），因此动词用单数形式 "has"。这种用法更正式，在传统语法中更受推崇。

All is gone
一切都过去
All have arrived。

a few 几个 修饰复数名词，are
I think there are a few in that box.
109

a little 一些 修饰不可数名词，is
I think there is a little in that bottle.

this This is my book.
these  These are my books.

that  That is Tim's shirt.
those Those are Tim's shirts.

There's none left.
left是leave当剩下讲的过去分词
