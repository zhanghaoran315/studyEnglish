## 冠词

```
戴在名词头上的帽子，没有特殊情况不能摘

冠词是一种词类，用来限定名词的用法和意义。在英语中，冠词分为三种：定冠词（the）、不定冠词（a/an）和零冠词（无冠词）。

a\an\the

a\an 一个、一间、一台
the 这 那 这些 那些
the student 这个、那个
the students 这些、那些

定冠词 the 确定的、知道的
不定冠词 a\an 不确定的，不知道的

零冠词的用法：

1. 用于复数名词前表示泛指
2. 用在职位、头衔以及国名、地名和其他专用名字前

不定冠词 a/an 的用法
1、用在单数可数名词前，泛指一类人或事物
2、第一次提到某人某物
3、表示速度或频率，意思是“每一”
4、用在固定搭配里面

定冠词 the 的用法
1、特指某人或某物
2、用于第二次提到的人或物前
3、用于自然界中独一无二的事物的名词前
4、用于单数可数名词前表示一类人或事物（这种用法和不定冠词的第一种用法一样）
5、用在乐器名词前
6、用在姓氏的复数名词前，表示全家人或者夫妇两个
7、用在形容词或副词前，表示一类人或事物
8、用在地理名词前，表示江、海洋、山脉、群岛、海峡、海湾

monk 和尚

There is a monk
The monk is Jack

不定冠词 a\an 的区别

an + 元音发音开头，其余用 a

an egg
an orange
an hour

特殊情况：国家，国籍，人名，城市名不用冠词

I am in China
I am in the China XXXX

25
冠词用法复习
There is an electric cooker 。。。 The cooker is
There is a table 。。。 The table is

总结：初次出现，不了解，不确定，用不定冠词 a/an
再次出现，了解了，确定了，用定冠词 the

     英语注重形合

Do you like book? XXXXXX
Do you like a book? XXXXXX

你喜欢书吗。这个书应该是泛指，应该用复数
Do you like books?

movie
n 电影 电影院

Do you like movies?

Do you like stories?

Do you like tea?

Do you like English?
```

# 动词

```
want 和 want to do 的区别

want 直接接名词/代词

want to do接动词不定式
后接动词不定式（to + 动词原形）

want sb to do
想让某人做某事

want doing
被动含义，较少用

carry
v 1.提 拿 背 抱 扛
2.携带 带有
3.支撑 承载
4.运输 传输

vt 拿来 带来

take

# 代词

```
every，no，any,some等代词以及由它们所构成的其它代词如everything，everyone,everybody等作主语时，谓语大多采用单数形式。

Isn't there anyone at home?
Everything is very quiet.
I am sure there is no one at home.
Everyone is in the garden.
Everybody wants to have lunch in the garden.
There is none left.

当代词特别指代复数名词或表达复数概念时，动词往往采用复数形式，反之，动词则用单数。（尤其不可数名词）
There are many apples in the refrigerator.
Some are fresh, some are stale.

Some of the homework is difficult for me.
Is there any beer in the bottle?

Is there any in the bottle?
homework和beer都是不可数名词，搭配单数

Are there any tomatoes in the basket?
Are there any in the basket?

None of the beer is left.
none指代beer，beer不可数名词

None of our passengers have small change.
None of our passengers has small change.

"None of our passengers have small change."
这里将 "none" 视为复数，强调 "not any"（没有一个），因此动词用复数形式 "have"。这种用法在非正式英语中更常见，尤其是当强调 "none" 指代多个个体时。

"None of our passengers has small change."
这里将 "none" 视为单数，强调 "not one"（连一个都没有），因此动词用单数形式 "has"。这种用法更正式，在传统语法中更受推崇。

All is gone
一切都过去
All have arrived。

a few 几个 修饰复数名词，are
I think there are a few in that box.
109

a little 一些 修饰不可数名词，is
I think there is a little in that bottle.

this This is my book.
these  These are my books.

that  That is Tim's shirt.
those Those are Tim's shirts.
