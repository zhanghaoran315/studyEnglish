ticket please

在日常口语中，有时候人们可能会省略冠词。虽然在正式的语法中，使用冠词是更准确的方式，但是在特定的情境下，可以使用省略冠词的形式。

因此，“Ticket please” 这样的句子在某些情况下可以被接受。不过，使用冠词会更符合正式的语法规则，所以在书面语或正式场合中，建议使用 "Could I have a ticket, please?" 或 "May I have a ticket, please?" 这样的句子。

### 冠词

```
戴在名词头上的帽子，没有特殊情况不能摘

冠词是一种词类，用来限定名词的用法和意义。在英语中，冠词分为三种：定冠词（the）、不定冠词（a/an）和零冠词（无冠词）。

a\an\the

a\an  一个、一间、一台
the  这 那 这些 那些
the student 这个、那个
the students 这些、那些

定冠词 the 确定的、知道的
不定冠词 a\an  不确定的，不知道的

零冠词的用法：
1. 用于复数名词前表示泛指
3. 用在职位、头衔以及国名、地名和其他专用名字前

不定冠词a/an的用法
1、用在单数可数名词前，泛指一类人或事物
2、第一次提到某人某物
3、表示速度或频率，意思是“每一”
4、用在固定搭配里面

定冠词the的用法
1、特指某人或某物
2、用于第二次提到的人或物前
3、用于自然界中独一无二的事物的名词前
4、用于可数名词单数前表示一类人或事物（这种用法和不定冠词的第一种用法一样）
5、用在乐器名词前
6、用在姓氏的复数名词前，表示全家人或者夫妇两个
7、用在形容词或分词前，表示一类人或事物
8、用在地理名词前，表示江、海洋、山脉、群岛、海峡、海湾

monk  和尚

There is a monk
The monk is Jack

不定冠词 a\an 的区别

an + 元音发音开头，其余用a

an egg
an orange
an hour

特殊情况：国家，国籍，人名，城市名不用冠词

I am in China 
I am in the China XXXX

be going to & will的区别
1.be going to说话那一刻之前早就已计划好的，will在说话的那一刻所做的决定


A: Mary is in hospital.
B: Yes, I konw, I am going to see her tomorrow.
A: Really!I will see her tomorrow.

A: Bob,we are going to spend our weekend in the country.
Do you want to come with us?
B: Great!

A: What's wrong?
B: I am in trouble.
A: Don't worry, I will help you.

trouble
n 麻烦 (机器、车辆等的)故障

worry
n 担心 担忧
v 担心 担忧

2.be going to客观上有迹象或证据表明即将要发生的事
will主观上根据经验判断未来要发生的事

LooK, it is going to rain.

The house is going to fall down

The flower is going to fade.

fade
n 淡入 淡出 
v 褪色 凋谢
adj 平淡的 乏味的

生气的 愤怒的

She will be happy if you come.

She will be angry if you absent.

imagine
v 猜想 认为

box-office
n 票房收入

3.will有时还用来表达请求或赞成，be going to则无此意

Will you open the window please?

Will you come with me?

Please turn off the lights before you leave.  ????

Yes, I will.

Don't be late!
No, I won't

如果没有明确的迹象区分打算计划、说话那一刻的临时计划或主客观对未来的推测，以及请求、赞成，二者往往可以互换。

无计划、无推测、无请求或赞成


I am going to miss you.
I will miss you.

I will buy a big house one day.
I am going to buy a big house on day.

I won't tell you the truth.
I am not going to tell you the truth.

数词表示数量的多少或顺序先后的词

数词分为基数词和序数词
```

基数词

[数词](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1667545072810859282&wfr=spider&for=pc)

```
一、基数词
1、数字1-12 是独立的，有各自的形式
one two three four five 
six seven eight nine ten 
eleven twelve

2、13-19 由对应的个位数词+teen构成

thirteen fourteen fifteen 
sixteen seventeen
eighteen nineteen
注意 thirteen fifteen eighteen 变化不规则

teen
n 青少年
adj 十几岁的 青少年的

3、20-90整十数字，由对应的个位数词+ty 构成
twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy
eighty ninety
注意：twenty thirty forty fifty eighty 变化不规则

4、非整十的两位数，即表达“几十几”由相对应的整十位数加上连字符—再加个位数构成
21 twenty—one 38 thirty—eight 45 forty—five

5、100-999
整百，写上百位数再加上hundred
two hundred 不是复数，hundred末尾无s
100 one hundred 300 three hundred 700 seven hundred
不是整百即表达“几百几十几”先说几百+and 再说几十几
148 one hundred and forty—eight
679 six hundred and seventy—nine

6、1000以上四位数，拼写规则：用逗号从右往左没三位加一个逗号，第一个逗号读作 thousand 第二个逗号读作million第三个逗号读作billion，hundred后不要忘记and

235,786,481

two hundred and thirty-five million,
seven hundred and eighty-six thousand,
four hundred and eighty-one




7、百：hundred 千：thousand 百万：million 十亿：billion
表达整百，整千，其后不能加s
表示不确定的数字时，通常后要加s与of 连用
hundreds of students 数百个学生
thousands of birds数千个鸟

二、基数词的用法
基数词的用法
1、表示数量的多少
I have three sisters 我有三个姐妹

2、表示年龄
I am twenty-five years old 我25岁

基数词放在years old（可省略）的前面。

4、表示倍数、次数 基数词+times

三倍、三次 three times

o’clock 点钟

past
n 过去
adj 过去的
adv 过去
prep 超过，多于

5、表达时间
整点：nine/nine o’clock 九点

直述法：9:20 nine twenty 2:15 two fifteen

倒述法：用到 past 过 、to 差

几点过几分：分钟 + past +时：four past six， 6:04

在年、月、季节、世纪前用介词in ,in 2020 in May

在具体的某一天用on ,on May 6th on Monday

class
n 班 班级 课 上课

grade 
等级 年级 级别

A.表示人或者物的数量，基数词放在可数名词复数前面（one除外）

E.用来计算。
例如：Two and six is eight.2加6等于8.
```

序数词

```
三、序数词
基数词变序数词的口诀

second，秒(时间单位)；

1、序数词的变化
1、2、3特殊记，结尾 t.d.d 
first second third
th从四起，八减t,九去e, f来把ve 替
第四fourth 第五 fifth 第八eighth 第九ninth
第十二twelfth

第十八 eighteenth
第十九 nineteenth

整十 ty 变成tie 再加th
twenty-twentieth thirty-thirtieth fifty-fiftieth
若是遇到几十几，只变个位就可以
twenty-three变成twenty-third
ninety-five 变成ninety-fifth

2、序数词的缩写
first  -- 1st 
second -- 2nd 
third  -- 3rd
fourth  -- 4th
twenty-first 21th

one hundredth 100th

3、序数词前面要加the
The second girl 第二个女孩 
The fourth day 第四天
在形容词前面可以使用序数词，表示第几最
The Yellow River is the second longest river in China
黄河是中国第二长河

序数词前可以加上不定冠词（a/an）用来表示‘再一’（first除外）

try
n v 尝试 试图 努力

We have tried it twice,but we will try it a third time
我们已经试过两次了，但我们将会再试一次

四、数的表达法
如何表达分数、小数、百分数
1、分数表达法：分子用基数词，分母用序数词
五分之一1/5, 读成one fifth. 
分子是1.分母用单数。
分子大于1，分母用复数 2/3 读成 two thirds
分母是2和4时，可用half和quarter 表示
1/2 one half 或者a half
3/4 three fourths或者three quarters
补充：如果分数大于1，要用整数部分+and +分数
5又1/3 读成 five and one thirds

2、百分数表达法：基数词+percent. percent没有复数形式
6% six percent 
30% thirty percent

2、小数表达法，小数点读point ,小数点前后都用基数词
0.45 zero point four five 
6.8 six point eight

两倍用twice / double 
三次以上：基数词+times
倍数 + 比较级 + than句型
This room is twice larger than that room 这个房间比那个大两倍


Monday    Mon
Tuesday   Tue
Wednesday Wed
Thursday  Thu
Friday   Fri

Saturday   Sat
Sunday     Sun 


二，如何用这些单词来表达日期和时间？
我们用逗号和and来连接日期和时间。例如：
Today is Monday, October 14th, 2023.（今天是2023年10月14日星期一。）

Tomorrow is Tuesday, October 15th, 2023.（明天是2023年10月15日星期二。）

The day after tomorrow is Wednesday, October 16th, 2023.（后天是2023年10月16日星期三。）

The day before yesterday was Sunday, October 13th, 2023.（前天是2023年10月13日星期日。）

你看，这些句子都遵循了一个固定的格式：星期+日期+年份。其中，星期用大写字母开头，日期用序数词表示，并加上th或st或nd或rd作为后缀，年份用四位数字表示，并加上逗号和and来分隔。学习这些句子，不仅可以帮助我们记住一周七天的英文单词，也可以帮助我们正确地表达日期和时间。
